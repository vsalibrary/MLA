# VSA Library: MLA Guide: Using Tables and Figures

Tables use rows and columns to display data. Format tables that use data from a source in the following manner:

Table 1

Most Popular Influencers on Douyin

| Chen Xiang                 | 49.14                     |
| Li Ziqi                    | 47.31                     |

Include an in-text citation in your caption to allow the reader to find it in your works cited list. In the above example there is no author, so the title would be used in the in-text citation, and there is no need to repeat the title of this source as it has been used as the description in the caption. You also need to include the full reference for the source in your works cited list.

"Number of Fans of the Leading Influencers on Douyin (Tiktok) in China as of May 13, 2022 (in Millions)." _Statista_, 13 May 2022, www.statista.com/statistics/1227126/china-most-followed-influencers-on-douyin-chinese-tiktok. Accessed 13 May 2022.

If you have generated the data yourself, there is no need to cite a source (unless there is any ambiguity).&#x20;

Other notes about using tables:

* If you have created the table yourself with your own data, you do not need to include any source information below the table, though you should make sure it is clear in your writing that you have done the research yourself.&#x20;
* Each table should be labelled “Table” (with a capital T) followed by a number (arabic numeral) in sequence e.g. Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 …
* When referring to the table in your writing use a lowercase t e.g. (see table 1).
* No fullstop is required at the end of the table title.
* Capitalise table titles in the same way as titles in your works cited list.
