### When do I use italics and quotation marks in a caption?

| Italics           | <p>Photograph or Painting.</p><p>E.g.  <em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></p>                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Quotation Marks” | An individual image from a website which already has a title or description in a caption, or a an individual cartoon or illustration. |
| No Formatting     | <p>A description you’ve created yourself. Do not capitalise each word.</p><p>E.g. Photograph of a dog skateboarding</p>               |
| Combination       | Screenshot of _Mona Lisa_                                                                                                             |

This formatting applies to the title as it appears in both the works cited entry and as it appears below the caption.

### Citing an image that you have edited

You can use a phrase like "adapted from" in the caption to show that you have made changes to the original image. In this case, the original black and white photograph has been colourised.

### Citing an image from a website

When you are use an image from a website, include a reference for the website where you found the image in your works cited list and an in-text citaton in the caption to link to the reference.

Remember, if you are publishing your image on a website you should use creative commons public domain images. This photograph image of Elvis meeting Nixon below is one of the most famous public domain images in the U.S. National Archives.

Because the caption below the image is not copied from the website, and is just a description of the image, no italics or quotation marks are required.

### Citing an image from a website that already has a caption

When you are use an image from a website that already has a description or title, you can use that as the caption and include the full reference for the page it came from in your works cited list.

If the image is a photograph or an work of art, the caption should be in _italics_, otherwise use quotation marks.
